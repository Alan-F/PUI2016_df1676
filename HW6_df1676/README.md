(I edit the LaTeX file in local environment, then upload to Authorea. But there's some tiny differences of LaTeX syntax between Authorea environment and mine, which leads to fail to export the paper as PDF format based on default Authorea layout. However, it works when you choose any other layout standard. Besides, I also upload the PDF and other LaTeX files in GitHub folder. )
