## Assignment 1

After forking and cloning kq320's HW folder, I committed my CitibikeReview_df1676 and make a request for adding this file into his repo.

Here's the request link:

https://github.com/kq320/PUI2016_kq320/pull/2

Here's the screen shot:

Thanks a lot for *Ziman Zhou* who promptly corrects my misunderstanding about ANOVA and ANCOVA.

Thanks a lot for *Ziman Zhou* who help me understand the Table 2.1 in HW4_3.



## Assignment 4

1. For the Pearson's and Spearman's correlation test, I use the whole dataset ( 201502 Citibike Data )to run the test.
2. In my opinion, it's much more meaningful to test the frequencies of different ages (or age intervals) by gender. So I did Pearson's and Spearman's test twice, one for age list, the other for my idea.
3. Thanks a lot for *Yao Wang* who remind me that the Null Hypothesis of K-S test is two samples are from the same distribution.
