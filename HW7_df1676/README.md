This **Visualization** work is mainly about The Goal Differences of each Team in every Round in 2015-2016 Serie A. **X-axis** representes Round 1-38; **Y-axis** representes 20 Teams in Initial Ascending Order. **Hover** shows TeamName, Round and Goal Difference of the corresponding match. **Color** representes Goal Difference, from Dark Green (negative) to Dark Red (positive). The plot is base on **bokeh**, a pre-install package in Anaconda.

Future work will focus on:

- [ ] Adjust colors to show the differences more clearly.
- [ ] Use [API](**http://sportsopendata.net/**) to acquire updated data, tracking records of 2016-2017 Serie A to updated the plot automatically (eg. Sort the X-axis: Team by their newly ranks)
- [ ] Add Toolbar to make users choose difference season and different countries' data.
