# Citibike Review

* Null and alternative hypothesis are correctly formulated.

* In order to test the hypothesis, the data needed to be categorized into two groups, "Young" and "Middle Aged," according to the team's definitions. This was accomplished, and all records that didn't fall into one of these two bins were dropped. Now a comparison on relative ridership on weekends vs weekdays can be performed for the desired categories.

* A t-Test would be a simple and appropriate test to use in this case. It is designed to compare the difference in effect of a dichotomous independent variable (in this case age - young or middle aged), on a single continuous, dependent variable (in this case, the time of week the ride occurred). With the stated significance level of alpha = 0.05, this seems like the right test to choose. Other possible tests are likely more complex than necessary.
